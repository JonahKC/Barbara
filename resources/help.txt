**Hey there sweetie! I'm Barbara! Here's some things you can ask me:**

%link â€“ Displays a customizable message when the command is run. Aliases for this command are %about and %info. 
`{prefix}screenshot [url] <fullPage> <scrollBy> <width> <height>` - Screenshots website.
`{prefix}link` - Check out some server-specific links or messages.
`{prefix}invite` - Invite barbara to your Discord! (Also available at <https://barbara.jcwyt.com>).
`{prefix}help admin` - View admin commands.
`{prefix}aiqa` ["Wikipedia page name in quotes"] [question] - Gets the Wikipedia page, then runs it through an API-based AI to answer your question. ~~It's probably wrong.~~ API credits can be found below.
`%prompt <length of answer> <temperature> [prompt]` - Continues your prompt and writes a paragraph with the length `<length of answer>` (if not specified, it automatically chooses a good length, also **length of answer is NOT in characters, it's in AI tokens. Each AI token is about 0.75 *words*, so make sure you're not setting it too high!**) and `<temperature>` is the creativity (low values are boring, and really high valued are gibberish. temperature goes from 0-100). This command uses an API, see below for credit links. **WARNING 2: GPT-Neo (the AI used to do this) was trained on the Pile, a dataset known to contain profanity, lewd, and otherwise abrasive language. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**
