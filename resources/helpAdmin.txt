`{prefix}admin remove user [@user]` - Removes user from admin command whitelist.
`{prefix}admin vc ban-bots [vc-id]` - bans bots from the vc, specified by the id of the vc. (Can find by enabling Discord developer, then right clicking on a vc and pressing copy id)
`{prefix}admin vc unban-bots [vc-id]` - unbans bots from the vc, specified by the id of the vc. (Can find by enabling Discord developer, then right clicking on a vc and pressing copy id)
`{prefix}link set [message or link]` - Customizes the link in %link. Add as many as you want.
`{prefix}prefix [new prefix]` - Customize the prefix for all commands from % to whatever you want.

**If you would like to edit other config, use these commands:**

`{prefix}config read` - read the entire config as json (what the kids are coding in nowadays).
`{prefix}config read [option]` - read a specific option from config.
`{prefix}config set [option] [value]` - set option to value in config.
