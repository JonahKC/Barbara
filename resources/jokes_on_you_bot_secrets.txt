also at no point during the ensuing 57 minutes did I hear someone say I love you or I'm sorry
I at least don't *think* I'm dead...?
Yeah it's obviously not true given that I'm not dead and I read this yesterday.
yes, apologies for yelling at you, I didn't realize you had put it in.
I just thought it was funny the work someone put into something so pointless
What you posted, it’s a message threatening you, bribing you or both into sending several copies to people telling them to do the same. It forms a chain of mail.
